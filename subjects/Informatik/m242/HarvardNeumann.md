## Gr√∂sse der Adresse:

Yes, the Harvard architecture and von Neumann architecture have different address sizes.

In the Harvard architecture, the size of the address bus for the instruction memory and data memory can be different, as they are separate. This means that the Harvard architecture can have larger address spaces for both instruction and data memory.

In the von Neumann architecture, the size of the address bus for both the instruction and data memory is the same. This can limit the maximum address space available to the processor.

However, it is important to note that the actual address sizes of these architectures can vary depending on the specific implementation and design choices made by the hardware manufacturer.

## Security

In terms of safety, the Harvard architecture and von Neumann architecture have different trade-offs.

The Harvard architecture has a potential safety advantage since it physically separates the instruction memory and data memory. This can help prevent certain types of software vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows and other attacks that exploit memory access. However, the Harvard architecture may require more complex hardware and software to manage the separate memory spaces.

The von Neumann architecture has a potential safety disadvantage since it uses a single memory space for both instructions and data. This means that certain software vulnerabilities can potentially allow an attacker to execute malicious code or modify the instructions that the processor executes. However, the von Neumann architecture can be simpler and easier to implement.

Ultimately, the safety of a computer architecture depends on many factors beyond just its memory design, including the specific implementation, software, and security measures in place.
